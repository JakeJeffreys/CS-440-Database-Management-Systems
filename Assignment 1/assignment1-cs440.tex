%=======================02-713 LaTeX template, following the 15-210 template==================
%
% You don't need to use LaTeX or this template, but you must turn your homework in as
% a typeset PDF somehow.
%
% How to use:
%    1. Update your information in section "A" below
%    2. Write your answers in section "B" below. Precede answers for all
%       parts of a question with the command "\question{n}{desc}" where n is
%       the question number and "desc" is a short, one-line description of
%       the problem. There is no need to restate the problem.
%    3. If a question has multiple parts, precede the answer to part x with the
%       command "\part{x}".
%    4. If a problem asks you to design an algorithm, use the commands
%       \algorithm, \correctness, \runtime to precede your discussion of the
%       description of the algorithm, its correctness, and its running time, respectively.
%    5. You can include graphics by using the command \includegraphics{FILENAME}

% no need to restate the problem --- the graders know which problem is which,
% but replacing "The First Problem" with a short phrase will help you remember
% which problem this is when you read over your homeworks to study.
The assignment is to be turned in before Midnight (by 11:59pm) on January 18th. You should turn in the solutions to this assignment as a PDF file through the TEACH website. The solutions should be produced using editing software programs, such as LaTeX or Word, otherwise they will not be graded.

\question{1}{Relational Model and SQL (8 points)}
Consider the following relational  schema:\\

Emp(\underline{{\it eid}:integer}, {\it ename}:string, {\it age}:integer, {\it salary}:real)\\
Works(\underline{{\it eid}:integer}, \underline{{\it did}:integer}, {\it pc\_time}:integer)\\
Dept(\underline{{\it did}:integer}, {\it dname}:string, {\it budget}:real, {\it managerid}:integer)\\
\vspace{10pt}

The underlined attributes are keys for their relations.
Note that a manager is an employee as well and their manager id and employee id are the same.
An employee can work in more than one department.
The pct\_time field of the Works relation shows the percentage of time that a given employee works in a given department.
Write the following queries in SQL.


\part{a} Print the {\it did} and {\it dname} of the departments with at least one full-time (100\%) employee. (1 point)\\
\part{solution}\\
SELECT DISTINCT D.did, dname FROM dept D, works W WHERE D.did=W.did AND pct\_time=100

\part{b} Print the names and ages of each employee who works in both the "Hardware" department and the "Software" department. (1 point)\\
\part{solution}\\
SELECT ename, age FROM emp E, works W, dept D WHERE E.eid=W.eid AND W.did=D.did AND dname='Software' AND ename IN (SELECT ename FROM emp E, works W, dept D WHERE E.eid=W.eid AND W.did=D.did AND dname='Hardware')

\part{c} Print the name of each employee whose salary does {\it not} exceed the budget of any department that he or she works in. (2 point)\\
\part{solution}\\
SELECT ename FROM emp WHERE ename NOT IN (SELECT ename FROM emp E, works W, dept D WHERE E.eid=W.eid AND W.did=D.did AND E.salary $>$ D.budget)

\part{d} If a manager manages more than one department, he or she controls the sum of all the budgets for those departments. Find the managerids of managers who control more than \$5 million. (2 points)\\
\part{solution}\\
SELECT managerid FROM (SELECT managerid, SUM(budget) AS bsum FROM dept GROUP BY managerid) T WHERE bsum $>$ 5000000

\part{e} For each department with more than 4 full-time-equivalent employees (i.e., where the part-time and full-time employees add up to at least that many full-time employees), print the did together with the number of employees that work in that department. (2 points)\\
\part{solution}\\
SELECT did, count FROM (SELECT did, SUM(pct\_time) AS sum, COUNT(eid) AS count FROM works GROUP BY did) T WHERE sum $>$ 400
